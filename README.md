# Programming Soapbox

1. Most of programming is centered around using methods,
infrastructure and tooling that force you and your team
to acknowledge all of the **implicit** assumptions *about* 
the code, and then to somehow make those assumptions 
**explicit** *in* the code.

2. The Pragmatic Programmer 20th Anniversary Edition, Chapter 4

    **Tip 36**: `You Can't Write Perfect Software`

3. The Practice of Programming, Chapter 5, Verse **Read before typing.**

    `Resist the urge to start typing; thinking is a worthwhile alternative.`

4. The K&R Chapter 5 Verse 1
```
int x = 1, y = 2, z[10];
int *ip;

ip = &x;
y = *ip;
*ip = 0;
ip = &z[0]; 
```
5. It's all just bits. Bits can't hurt you.

    1. Unless of course, the bit that you just flubbed triggers an 
    output on a safety significant machine or subsystem that you 
    happen to be standing near. If that's the case, the bits might 
    just kill you. 

        1. Be cautious, be paranoid, take breaks. Think it through.
        It isn't worth dying over. No matter how many people are 
        standing over your shoulder, using you as an excuse to not
        work and pretending to be grouchy about it.

6. Don't touch the wires if you can help it. They have this
confounding tendency to let the magic smoke out of the machine.
When the magic smoke gets out, it's very hard to put it back.

7. Laughing at the problem helps.
